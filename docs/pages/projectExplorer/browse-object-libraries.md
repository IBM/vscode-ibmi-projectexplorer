# Browse Object Libraries

The **Object Libraries** heading is the location to browse for libraries defined in the `curlib`, `objlib`, `preUsrlibl`, and `postUsrlibl` of the project's `iproj.json`.
Typically these are the libaries of interest while doing application development as it includes any libraries that the target objects are built into.
